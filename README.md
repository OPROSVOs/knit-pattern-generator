# knit-pattern-generator
A tool for creating knitting patterns to create guides

Generates an image with numbered rows and columns in which knit symbols can be set to visualize a knitting pattern.
I haven't found a free one or some tool that just did the job right, so here is a simple one.

Originally its written in german but this is a roughly translated version.
Rows can be optionally only be odd numbered, simple colors can be used as background and it has a very simple way of saving and loading in the browser.

This one works as standalone and offline. Tested in Chrome 101.
I hosted this earlier because the recent CORS rules broke things but having everything inline seems to work.
To run it just download the .html and open it in a recent browser.

To save/export the final image in the generator: Right click on the grid and save-as.
